This is a set of Matlab programs created to determine the diffusion length of a bulk semiconducting material. The user inputs cathodoluminescence data (by default .png files, can be changed at the top of the code), and will be prompted by the program to cut the data to the desired length. Can be done for the average over a material or spatially along a line.
